LTI WHMIS Quiz Sample
---------------------

This is an example LTI quiz with a WHMIS theme.

To install, copy these files to the root directory of your webserver and change the variable `$SITE_URL` in `whmis.php` to match your server name (if it is on a weird port, use syntax like `http://example.com:1234`)

The LTI launch point for the quiz is `whmis.php`
